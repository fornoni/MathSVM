About
-----
One of the most successful machine learning tools used to solve 
classification and regression problems is the Support Vector Machine 
(SVM) [1].

This project presents the very basic theory of linear classifiers, 
max-margin classifiers and Support Vector Machines and explores the use 
of Mathematica (c) to solve the optimization problems that arise. 

Following the presentation in [1], we explicitly derive, implement and 
compare several classifiers, demonstrating them on synthetic 2D-data 
generated by the user, with visualizations involving direct 
hyper-parameters manipulations. 
This project can thus be considered a hands-on introduction to the topic.

Usage
-----
Open MathematicaSVM.nb with Mathematica (c) and follow the instructions. 
The main algorithms and implementations are also synthetically presented 
in Presentation.nb. A pdf version of the notebook is also available for
previewing the material.
